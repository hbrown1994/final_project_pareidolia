# Screen Saver Study 1 (Pareidolia)

Final Project for Intermediate Internet Art

---Only works in FireFox & Chrome---

This audiovisual composition takes the user's current Country Code, city, zipcode, latitude, longitude, internet provider, and IP address. This data is converted to their numerical utf-8 character codes. Next, these numerical character codes are used to create 9 wavetable oscillators, these oscillator's frequencies over time, the duration of each synth instance, and the duration of the musical composition as a whole. This data is also used to dynamically generate the 3D animation seen on the screen.

This work begins as a screen of colored noise, the sound in silence. Over time, this image begins to reveal ever changing, oscillating visual forms while the audio fades into a collection of raw, clearly discernible digital waveforms. I equate this process to how internet companies filter large collections of seemingly meaningless user data (noise/nothingness) into precise tracking devices to exploit human beings. A form of capitalistic Pareidolia.
