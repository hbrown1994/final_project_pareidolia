# Screen Saver Study 1 (Pareidolia)

Final Project for Intermediate Internet Art

---Only works in FireFox & Chrome---

This work begins as a screen of colored noise, in silence. Over time, this image begins to reveal ever changing, oscillating visual forms while the audio fades into a collection of raw, starkly discernible digital waveforms. These audio & visual formations are generated from the user's current country, city, state, zipcode, latitude, longitude, internet provider, and IP address. I equate this process to how internet companies filter large collections of seemingly meaningless user data (noise/nothingness) into precise tracking devices to exploit human beings. A form of capitalistic Pareidolia.
